# CVEScrape
CVEScrape, well, it's in the name :)... CVEScrape is written in python and scrapes for CVE's off the internet either by searching keyword or getting the latest available. Currently only exploit-db is supported, although I intend to add multiple websites to scrape from and organazing all the data into most recent order. This for me is just a practice for webscraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup and also data mining and analysis. Selenium was a complete pain so I may convert this project to Scrapy or Pyppeteer.
